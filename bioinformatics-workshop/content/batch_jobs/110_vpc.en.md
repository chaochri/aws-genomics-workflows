title: "Creating a VPC"
weight: 110
---

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) has multiple components that need to be set. 
For the simplicity of this workshop we are going to run a predefined template 
of a VPC using 
[AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) 
(CDK). The VPC will have private subnets for AWS batch to use for running the 
bioinformatics tasks.

Navigate to the Cloud9 environment you've created in the previous section of 
this workshop.

Open the file under `bioinformatics-workshop/code/vpc/app.json`, set the 
[region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) 
(line #2) you want to use (e.g., us-east-1, us-east-2, etc.) and change the 
accountId (line #3) to your 
[AWS account id](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html).

:::code{showLineNumbers=true language=json}
{
    "region": "us-west-2",
    "accountId": "111111111111",
    "vpcName": "biotech-vpc",
    "cidr": "10.0.0.0/16",
    "maxAzs": 2
}
:::


When done save the file.

In Cloud9, open a terminal window, and navigate to the vpc folder.
:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true language=bash}
cd ~/environment/bioinformatics-workshop/code/vpc
:::

Install node.js version 16.3.0
:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true language=bash}
nvm install v16.3.0
:::

Install the latest version of CDK
:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true language=bash}
npm install -g aws-cdk --force
:::

::alert[We are using the --force flag to make sure we get the latest version of the CDK and ignore update notices]

Install the necessary modules for the vpc app
:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true language=bash}
npm install
:::

Deploy the vpc
:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true language=bash}
