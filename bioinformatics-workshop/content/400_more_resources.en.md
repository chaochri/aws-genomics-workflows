You've successfully finished the bioinformatics workshop where you learned how 
to: 
- Set a research environment using services such as S3, EC2, and Cloud9,
- Run tasks at scale with AWS Batch,
- And orchestrate a workflow using Step Functions.


You can navigate to the 
[Genomics Workflows on AWS](https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/) 
site to learn more on how to run genomics pipelines on AWS.

Also make sure you check the 
[Amazon Genomics CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/genomics-cli/) tool.

Amazon Genomics CLI is an open source tool for genomics and life science 
customers that simplifies and automates the deployment of cloud infrastructure, 
providing you with an easy-to-use command line interface to quickly setup and 
run genomics workflows on Amazon Web Services (AWS) specified by languages like 
WDL. By removing the heavy lifting from setting up and running genomics 
workflows in the cloud, software developers and researchers can automatically 
provision, configure and scale cloud resources to enable faster and more.
