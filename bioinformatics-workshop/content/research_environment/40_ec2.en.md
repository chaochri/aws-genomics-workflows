Use the AWS console search bar to find EC2 and then click on EC2.

![search ec2](/static/images/compute_and_storage/09_find_ec2.png)

On the top right of the screen, make sure the selected region is the same one 
you’ve used for the bucket.

![region selected](/static/images/compute_and_storage/10_region_selected.png)

Click on “Launch instance” and select “Launch instance”.

We are going to use Amazon Linux 2 for this example but you could use other 
operating system types, such as Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.  
Click on the “Select” button next to the “Amazon Linux 2 AMI”.

The next step is to choose the type of machine we need for our specific needs 
which will include the CPU capabilities, amount of RAM, and if we need a GPU. 
[Learn more about EC2 instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). 
For this example we are going to use a compute optimized machine with 16 vCPUs 
and 32 [GiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Multiple-byte_units) of memory 
(c5.4xlarge).

To find the instance type use the filter and choose c5 from the list.

Check the box next to the c5.4xlarge instance type and then click on 
“Next: Configure Instance Details”.

![launch instance 3](/static/images/compute_and_storage/12_launch_instance_3.png)

Leave all the default settings and only change the IAM Role option to the role 
you’ve previously created.  
Click “Next: Add Storage”.

![launch instance 4](/static/images/compute_and_storage/12_launch_instance_4.png)

We are going to make sure the volume is encrypted. Click on the encryption drop 
down at the end of the volume row and choose “(default) aws/ebs”.

Click on “Next: Add Tags”.

Now we are going to add tags to the instance, as before this can help us 
understand the resources we are using and the costs related to them. We are 
also going to add a “Name” (case sensitive) tag which will be used as the 
instance name.  
Add the following tags  
- Name: biotech-research (or any other name you would like).  
- Environment: Dev (alternatives could be “Production”, “QA”, “Research”, etc.).  
- Project: Biotech (or any other name to describe the use for this instance).  
Click on “Next: Configure Security Group”.

![launch instance 7](/static/images/compute_and_storage/12_launch_instance_7.png)

The next part is to allow access to the instance by opening port from specific 
location. For this example we are only going to allow port 22 (SSH) from your
current IP address. This could be changed later on, if needed.  
Choose “Create a **new** security group”, give the security group a name 
(e.g., biotech-research-instance), and add description.  
In the rules section, choose Type - "SSH", Source - select "My IP" (this will 
set your current IP address), and optionally add description 
(e.g., SSH from office).  
Click on “Review and Launch”.

![launch instance 8](/static/images/compute_and_storage/12_launch_instance_8.png)

Review the settings and click on “Launch”.

![launch instance 9](/static/images/compute_and_storage/12_launch_instance_9.png)

If it’s the first time you are launching an EC2 instance, you’ll need to create 
a new key pair. If you have an existing key pair you could use it but make sure 
you have access to it on your computer, otherwise create a new key pair and 
click on “Download Key Pair”. If you are using Linux or Mac save this file 
under ~/.ssh/ and change the permission to the file - open terminal and run the 
following:

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true language=bash}
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/biotech-research.pem
:::

This will set the appropriate permissions to the file so it can be used to log 
in to the EC2 instance later on.

If you are using Windows, use the 
[following instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html) 
to convert the pem file to a PuTTY file and use it to connect to the EC2 
instance.  
Click on “Launch Instances”.

![launch instance 10](/static/images/compute_and_storage/12_launch_instance_10.png)

We are done setting up the AWS resources. In the next section we are going to 
upload files to our S3 bucket, install tools in the EC2 instance, and run them.
