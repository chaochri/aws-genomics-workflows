Log in to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and navigate to 
the Amazon S3 service (you can find it under the storage section or use the 
search bar to find it).

Give a name to the bucket, this name need to be a globally unique name (just 
like domain names), a suggestion is to prefix the name with your company name, 
e.g., myawesomecompany-biotech-research-files. Note the bucket name as we are 
going to use it later in the IAM policy section.

Choose a region - This is a geographical location where you are going to store 
your files. We are going to use the same region when launching the rest of the 
infrastructure.

Keep the setting to Block all public access. We want to keep our bucket and the 
data that reside in it private.

**Bucket versioning** \- keep this featured disabled. If you enable versioning, 
overriding the files will create a new versions for them and also keep the old 
files. 
[Learn more about bucket versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html).

Tags are optional but very useful to figure out which resources you are using 
and also figure out their costs. In this example we are adding 2 different 
tags, Environment and Project.
